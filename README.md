I'm a **Artist & Entrepreneur** blending **imagery, history, aesthetic, product design, and prompting** to build special projects.

## background

- **early beginnings**: i discovered Vine on day one in high school, grew a following with stop-motion animations, and learned the power of organic communities.
- **social-hacking**: I joined a start-up [**fooji**](https://fooji.com/) as the third member, originally focused on ordering food via Twitter emojis. Through a successful activation of a concert ticket giveaway on my One Direction fan account, I inspired their pivot to an activations based business model.
- **indiana university**: Studied advertising, where Michael Uslan (producer of *The Dark Knight*) taught me about Hollywood’s cash outs of a billion-dollars a movie in China's market, where ghosts (+ the living dead) are censored and can't be portrayed.
- Since then, I've navigated Los Angeles’ music scene and New York’s art world, collaborating with notable figures such as [**Anthony Haden-Guest**](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/jean-michel-basquiat-death-542345). I've traveled for photoshoots, including for UK's [**The Times**](https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/IMG_37841-1.jpg), and created AI music artists like Lisa Mona, with tracks available on Spotify, and real artists early like [**Kevin George**](https://notion.online/when-youre-alone-by-kevin-george/). I’m self-taught in music production, and one of my tracks, produced late at night in my car, was featured in [**Music Garden**](https://www.sound.xyz/0x3e882b64b26a9351e7312e40649a43947b38091f/post/b899bfca-1719-4fbf-8e92-748af6b2ef04)’s sound.xyz blog. My work was also showcased at Fred Segal’s West Hollywood NFT exhibition by Karsen Daily, as one of [**27**](https://www.27times.xyz) selected artists.

## current focus
