# Technology, Music, Politics, and Art: A Vision for the Future

This letter frameworks my perspective on **technology**, **music**, **politics**, and **art**. A recount of observations, personal experience, and aspirations of a more free and unrestricted future.

## Tech, Music, and the Future

In this conceptual framework, both **technology** and **music** fall on the positive end of an idyll chart, in contrast to *Dark Ages* mentality. As innovations like robotic home construction, abundant energy, and automated farms become reality, society’s focus shifts toward health, art, and personal expression. This trend suggests a future where curating our personality and designing our environment only become more pertinent to modern experience, enabled by technological abundance.

## Kanye West’s Presidential Run and Elon Musk’s Support

On July 4, 2020, **Kanye West** tweeted his intention to run for President of the United States, a post with a quick supporting reply from **Elon Musk**: *"You have my full support!"* This moment, while seemingly impulsive, marks a fascinating convergence of entertainment, technology, and politics. Kanye West's influence extends beyond this event, his music has shaped artists from **Paul McCartney** to **Billie Eilish**. However, his suspension from social media for provocative posts, including the ones intentionally anti-Semitic, highlight the tension between artistic persona (or persona) and public perception. Despite this, Kanye’s work reflects a deconstructive creativity closer to a civil rights advocate than the negative labels often attached to him. This is consistent with all of our best, merely exaggerated in raw performance art. 

## Personal Anecdotes and Reflections

Small actions can yield profound impacts. For Kanye, 'Putting on the red hat' is his version of being Rosa Parks, or Socrates in his commitment to truth. A few years back, I shot a music video for, and gave my old laptop to a 15-year-old aspiring artist. He used it to make a song that has over **11 million Spotify streams**. Turning a $500 donation into $50,000 of value. Moments like these inspire me, as does listening to podcasts like David Senra’s *[Founders Podcast](https://www.founderspodcast.com/)*. I’m drawn by the power a music artist like **The Weeknd** has to bring over 100,000 fans to a single concert. This evokes potential for once mysterious low-lifes, or designed figures to command influence like political leaders.

## Critiques of Political and Social Trends

Current political figures like **AOC** and **Bernie Sanders** often oppose technological progress, without realizing it. Prioritizing their own control over innovation, or risking future security & freedom. I look for a return to a *"Wild West"* ethos, unrestricted exploration, free from bureaucratic suits and rules that favor the slow. Meanwhile, dangerous double standards abound: men are attacked for past behavior, while platforms like **OnlyFans** are promoted. This dynamic, alongside the stagnation of apps like **Tinder** and **TikTok**, fuels my desire to build better alternatives and design digital landscapes - I'm also ready to replace the overflowing gas station, fast-foods, smoke shop, and liquor stores on every street corner.

## Art, Influence, and the Future

The art world’s elite is a small circle. My friend, **Anthony Haden Guest**, who chronicled New York’s 1980s art scene and conducted **Basquiat**’s last interview, noted that only about 100 people held sway in that era’s fine art community. Today, artists like Basquiat and **Warhol** command astronomical valuations - Warhol’s *Marilyn* print sold for **$250 million**, and Basquiat’s works today exceed **$100 million**. Yet, the next great artist could emerge from anywhere, unbound by nationality or expectation. I envision launching an art gallery and podcast in the **Network Cloud**, collaborating with Anthony to foster serious discourse and elevate artist voices, while avoiding a personal spotlight. Just like a female U.S. President can't just be cherry picked, neither can the next serious American, or Un-American artist. After all, Andy Warhol was shot by a self pro-claimed misandsrist who wrote a book stating all men should be ground to meat. He'd be a billionaire today, and he probably would've been cancelled or worse. 

## Conclusion

Ignoring **Technology**, **music**, **politics**, and **art's** connection, is becoming harder every day. At risk of sounding absurd, the default is politicians talk about other politicians, rappers talk about other rappers, and tech guys only talk about tech guys. This is starting to destroy the careers of people who ignore it. There's an importance of returning from the career - to the child, perhaps as a globe. We might need to figure out how to hang out with friends again. Smartphones have given us all a public persona, something which only existed for the rare celebrity in the past. These things are often ignored due to societal norms, assumptions, expectation, and pressure. There's no college or school cirriculum talking about how to manage your online following, who to keep up with for the rest of your life. The average person only really gets to know 800 people by name in a lifetime. A family member of mine told me X is an echo chamber, i said how? I can literally see what the Supreme Leader of Iran is posting, the comments below it, and my ex-girlfriend's re-tweets. From a peaceful artist and rapper's conceptual presidential run, to the conceptual power of network states, these ideas sculpt a world of soft marble. My experience finding early talent, early trends, critiquing trends, and dreaming of freedom reveal my belief in a future where creativity and innovation are given credit. The **Network State** is likely the vessel for this vision.
