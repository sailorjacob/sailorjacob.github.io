# Technology, Music, Politics, and Art: A Vision for the Future

This essay explores the dynamic interplay between **technology**, **music**, **politics**, and **art**, weaving together observations, personal experiences, and aspirations for a more creative and unrestricted future.

## Tech, Music, and the Future

In Balaji Srinivasan's conceptual framework, both **technology** and **music** align on the positive side of a technological spectrum, contrasting with a *Dark Ages* mentality. As innovations like robotic home construction, abundant solar energy, and automated crop farms become reality, society’s focus shifts toward art, health, and personal expression. This evolution suggests a future where curating our personalities and designing our world become central to human experience, enabled by technological abundance.

## Kanye West’s Presidential Run and Elon Musk’s Support

On July 4, 2020, **Kanye West** tweeted his intention to run for President of the United States, a declaration met with swift support from **Elon Musk**: *"You have my full support!"* This moment, while seemingly impulsive, marks a fascinating convergence of entertainment, technology, and politics. Kanye’s influence extends beyond this event—his music has shaped artists from **Paul McCartney** to **Billie Eilish**. However, his suspension from social media for controversial posts, including those labeled anti-Semitic, highlights the tension between his artistic persona and public perception. Despite this, Kanye’s work reflects a deconstructive creativity closer to a civil rights advocate than the negative labels often attached to him.

## Personal Anecdotes and Reflections

Small actions can yield profound impacts. I once made a music video for and gave my old laptop to a 15-year-old, who used it to create a song that amassed over **11 million Spotify streams**, turning a $500 investment into $50,000 of worth. Moments like these inspire me, as does listening to podcasts like David Senra’s *[Founders Podcast](https://www.founderspodcast.com/)*. I’m fascinated by the power dynamics in music—artists like **The Weeknd** drawing over 100,000 fans to a single concert evoke the potential for cultural figures to command influence akin to political leaders, mirroring concepts like the **network state**.

## Critiques of Political and Social Trends

Current political figures like **AOC** and **Bernie Sanders** often oppose technological progress, prioritizing control over innovation. I yearn for a return to a *"Wild West"* ethos—unrestricted exploration, free from bureaucratic suits and rules that favor the slow. Meanwhile, societal double standards abound: men face scrutiny for past behavior, yet platforms like **OnlyFans** are celebrated. This hypocrisy, alongside the stagnation of apps like **Tinder** and **Bumble**, fuels my desire to build better alternatives and rethink urban landscapes—replacing gas stations and fast food with healthier, more innovative options.

## Art, Influence, and the Future

The art world’s elite is a small circle. My friend **Anthony Haden Guest**, who chronicled New York’s 1980s art scene and conducted **Basquiat**’s last interview, noted that only about 100 people held sway in that era’s fine art community. Today, artists like Basquiat and **Warhol** command astronomical valuations—Warhol’s *Marilyn* print sold for **$250 million**, and Basquiat’s works frequently exceed **$100 million**. Yet, the next great artist could emerge from anywhere, unbound by nationality or expectation. I envision launching an art gallery and podcast at the **Network School**, collaborating with Anthony to foster serious discourse and elevate new voices, all without seeking personal spotlight.

## Conclusion

**Technology**, **music**, **politics**, and **art** are deeply interconnected, each influencing the other in unexpected ways. From Kanye’s bold presidential bid to the potential of network states, these fields reveal a world ripe for change. My experiences—mentoring young talent, critiquing societal trends, and dreaming of an artistic renaissance—underscore a belief in a future where creativity and innovation combine. The **Network School** could be a beacon for this vision, blending art and technology to drive meaningful progress.
